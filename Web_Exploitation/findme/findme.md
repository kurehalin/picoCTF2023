## Problem
Help us test the form by submiting the username as test and password as test!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Solution
1. once launch the instance, it'll direct you to a portal login page. It'll ask you to type username:test and password:test!, you'll get nothing in that page.
2. Notice that it seems not directly access the bank page, let's try something. First, i click last page, i then access a blank page and with a base64 encoded id `bF90aGVfd2F5XzAxZTc0OGRifQ==`on the url. Decrypting it will get `l_the_way_01e748db}`which seems a part of flag.
3. Then click last page buttom again, you'll get the suffix of base64 encrption `cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs`which in plaintext is `picoCTF{proxies_al`

## flag
picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_01e748db}

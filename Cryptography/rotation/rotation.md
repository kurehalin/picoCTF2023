# Problem
You will find the flag after decrypting this file Download the encrypted flag here.
## Solution
After downloading the file, we got the string: xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}.
It seems like the flag format but with wrong words.
1. Let's try with caesar encrytion, open the online decoder.
2. try every 25 shifts, when at the a->s shift, we'll get the flag.

## flag
picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_555957f3}
